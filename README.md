# Employee Attrition Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting employee attrition using various algorithms and real-time data collected through Google Form.

## Project Overview
The project focuses on developing predictive models to identify employees at risk of leaving an organization. It utilizes a dataset comprising employee-related features such as number of projects, average monthly hours, job satisfaction level, and more.

## Key Features
- Implemented machine learning algorithms include Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and AdaBoost.
- The tuned AdaBoost model demonstrated the highest accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score among all models tested.
- Real-time data collected via Google Form enhances the relevance and applicability of the predictive models.





## Acknowledgments
- The project uses real-time data collected through Google Form, which enriches the predictive models with current organizational data.
